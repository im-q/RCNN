The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the \"doc\" \n    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The\n    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also \n    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-\n    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are \n    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.\n    \n    THE BASIC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS\n    ---------------------------\n    Written by:       Philip Hazel\n    Email local part: ph10\n    Email domain:     cam.ac.uk\n    University of Cambridge Computing Service,\n    Cambridge, England.\n    Copyright (c) 1997-2012 University of Cambridge\n    All rights reserved.\n    \n    PCRE JUST-IN-TIME COMPILATION SUPPORT\n    -------------------------------------\n    Written by:       Zoltan Herczeg\n    Email local part: hzmester\n    Emain domain:     freemail.hu\n    Copyright(c) 2010-2012 Zoltan Herczeg\n    All rights reserved.\n    \n    STACK-LESS JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER\n    --------------------------------\n    Written by:       Zoltan Herczeg\n    Email local part: hzmester\n    Emain domain:     freemail.hu\n    Copyright(c) 2009-2012 Zoltan Herczeg\n    All rights reserved.\n    \n    THE C++ WRAPPER FUNCTIONS\n    -------------------------\n    Contributed by:   Google Inc.\n    Copyright (c) 2007-2012, Google Inc.\n    All rights reserved.\n    \n    THE \"BSD\" LICENCE\n    -----------------\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n    \n      * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, \n        this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    \n      * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright \n        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the \n        documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    \n      * Neither the name of the University of Cambridge nor the name of Google \n        Inc. nor the names of their contributors may be used to endorse or \n        promote products derived from this software without specific prior \n        written permission.\n    \n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\n    AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE \n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \n    ARE DISCLAIMED.
